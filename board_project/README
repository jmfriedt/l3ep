Input: 1-PPS from GPS receiver, simulated with a sigalarm from the PC running 
       a unix flavor. This signal is detected as a GPIO state change and
       timestamped using a timer input capture.
Output: PWM followed by a low pass filter to act as a D/A converter
Control: microprocessor frequency

Two board simulation options (to be renamed PPSControl.c): either using the 
unix alarm signal (default), or the GLUT option which might extend the 
compatibility beyond unix. Accuracy performances seem similar for both delay 
implementations.

Requires simavr, available at https://github.com/buserror/simavr
1. clone simavr
2. copy this directory in the example subdirectory of simavr
3. install libelf-dev if not available (required dependency)
4. in simavr: make
will recursively compile all board examples including the content of this directory.
