Input: 1-PPS from GPS receiver, simulated with a sigalarm from the PC running 
       a unix flavor. This signal is detected as a GPIO state change and
       timestamped using a timer input capture.
Output: PWM followed by a low pass filter to act as a D/A converter
Control: microprocessor frequency

Two board simulation options (to be renamed PPSControl.c): either using the 
unix alarm signal, or the GLUT option which might extend the compatibility 
beyond unix. Accuracy performances seem similar for both delay implementations.
