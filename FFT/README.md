8-bit microcontroller Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) example based on the Maxim 
Applicaiton note 3722 provided for reference since hardly found on the web any 
more. The number of intput samples is fixed (N=256 in maxqfft.h) and the software
computes the magnitude of the FFT of the real signal, hence providing N/2 output
items.
